This repo comprises my submission for the final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera. It contains the following 4 files:

1. `README.md` - This file
2. `run_analysis.R` - An R script that downloads a motion analysis data set from the web and reformats it as "tidy" data
    - Can be run as is to download and produce the final data set 
    - Requires the plyr and dplyr packages
3. `tidydata.txt` - A copy of the final reformatted data set
4. `CodeBook.md` - An explanation of the variables in tidydata.txt

For an explanation of the code itself, please see the inline comments in `run_analysis.R`.
